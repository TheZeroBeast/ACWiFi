# How To Contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to us](https://github.com/TheZeroBeast/ACWiFi/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Please use Arduino IDE and comment your code where possible/practicable.
