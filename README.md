# ACWiFi

This firmware was written using the Arduino IDE and has allows an ESP8266 module (Wemos D1 R1 mini in this instance) to communicate with a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
split system air conditioner via the CNS connector on the indoor unit control PCB. 

This allows control and monitoring of the attached air conditioner via MQTT. 

An open-source PCB design that supports this firmware can be found here https://github.com/dvisser/MHI-ESP-PCB
